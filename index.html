<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Hannah Tran, and I am from Southern California! I come from a family of five, and though we have moved three times in the last ten years, we are only about one hundred feet from the house we started in. </p>
<p>I am currently enrolled at Brigham Young University and am majoring in Computer Science with an emphasis in Bioinformatics. Though I haven't officially declared it, I also intend to work toward a minor in microbiology. I love all things computer programming and physical science, so I'm excited for what the future of my education has for me.
